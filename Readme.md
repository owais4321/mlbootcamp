# Bootcamp Resource Repository

## Description:
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for an ML (Machine Learning) Bootcamp, providing a structured learning path for participants. It contains slides, assignments, and code examples to facilitate the understanding and practical application of various ML concepts.

## Repository Structure:
1. Slides: This directory contains a collection of slide decks that cover different topics in ML. The slides are organized in a logical sequence, starting from foundational concepts and progressing towards advanced techniques. Each slide deck is designed to provide clear explanations, visuals, and examples to aid comprehension.

2. Assignments: This directory includes a set of hands-on assignments that allow participants to practice implementing ML algorithms and techniques. The assignments are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in the slides and provide an opportunity for practical experimentation. Each assignment is accompanied by detailed instructions, guiding participants through the problem statement, data exploration, model development, and evaluation.

3. Code Examples: This directory hosts a collection of code examples that demonstrate the implementation of ML algorithms and techniques using popular libraries and frameworks. The code examples are provided in various programming languages, such as Python or R, and are organized based on specific ML tasks or topics. Each code example includes well-commented code, making it easy to understand and modify for individual use cases.
